# Rumor API

This project was build for playField during an internship by Jelle Vercalsteren.

The API is a FastAPI project that uses a MongoDB Atlas backend and can be deployed to Google Cloud App Engine.

## Deployment
The deployment will be handled by BitBucket Pipelines. Make sure all the environment variables present
